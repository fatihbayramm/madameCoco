# MADAME COCO PROJECT
This project is a frontend project made for a student to try to improve himself. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js languages were used.

# Why was this project made ?
First of all, I did this project to improve myself in the frontend field and bring it to the next level, and I think it was successful. This project could be done much more easily with React, but I am not familiar with React yet. So I decided to do it in pure JavaScript and got to work. I communicated with Madame Coco's backend through a proxy I set up with Node.js. By pulling the data from the backend, I put the data into the frontend architecture I created and this project emerged. I'm proud of my project.

# Architectural structure
The architectural structure of this project is based on a single-page HTML structure. Common views are used on pages. For example, on the product list page, the header and footer sections are written in separate HTML files and imported to the list page. The page was then arranged according to the incoming data. The code of each page in the project is divided into sections. HTML, CSS, JavaScript codes have been turned into templates. In this way, the project has become more organized. The codes of the relevant page can be found more easily, thus avoiding code complexity. The established architectural structure is clearly seen in the directories. As for the backend, a proxy was written with Node.js to overcome the CORS error for communication and communication with the backend was made through it. Additionally, handling the requests is also done by Node.js.
